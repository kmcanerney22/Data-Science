Instead of solving it, consider two students' approaches to the problem:\n\n> There are two piles of beans.  One pile has 1 white bean out of 3 total beans (the other 2 beans are black), so 1/3 of the beans are white.  The other pile has 6 white beans out of a total of 8 beans (2 beans are black), so 6/8 of the beans are white.  If the two piles are combined, what is the fraction of beans that are white?","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00010-e4cb8fa6-77bf-4acd-845c-778ee069a5e3"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"2.1 - Here is Student A's solution.
